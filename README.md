## Overview
### Description
Integrated platform for building and sustaining 1:1 mentoring relationships.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity/Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. A website version could potentially have more display room but the mobile version will be focused on ease of use and accesibility.
- **Story:** Mentors and mentees can choose to connect with each other on the platform, and the app will be streamlined in presenting critical info to both the mentor/mentee. Scheduling meetings, sharing and filing resources, and chat will be the main features.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and it would be especially useful for anyone looking for career development opportunities. Many organizations that offer mentoring partnerships could use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as frequent or infrequent depending upon the mentor/mentee relationship. Since the goal of the app is to sustain these mentoring relationships, the app could send push notifications on a weekly/biweekly basis to both parties if there's a lack of interaction with the app.
- **Scope:** First, we would start with building the mentor/mentee interface which would include an overall ToDo, chat feature, and ability to view each other's schedules. This could perhaps evolve into scheduling recurring meetings and also a cleanly organized resources tab for all the outside links that are being referenced in the mentoring. It could perhaps evolve into adding many more features that are useful depending on the mentoring relationship, and present different interfaces depending on whether the user is logged in as a mentor/mentee.
